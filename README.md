# Rock Paper Scissors

This basic project was done with regards to a course on Coursera, by University of Michigan.

This is a basic PHP project to display a three page web application to play rock, paper, scissors.

You must run these files in your PHP server. Make a folder under your htdocs folder and then place your files in that folder. The htdocs folder is in different locations depending on your web server:

Windows XAMPP: c:\xampp\htdocs
